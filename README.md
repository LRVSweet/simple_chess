# simple_chess

simple_chess is my first coding project.  I created it at the end of Codecademy's CS101 course.  It presents the user with a visual interface for playing chess in the terminal.  It is very simple and doesn't check moves for legality or detect checks or checkmates.  Special moves such as castling, pawn promotion, and en passant are not yet supported.  If I return to the project in the future then I'd like add those features.
